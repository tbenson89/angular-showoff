            I have experience working with Angular 2+ for the past 2 years. I have built several projects using Angular
            2+ including a e-commerce website and a social media platform. I am familiar with the basics of Angular 2+
            such as components, services, routing, and forms. I have also used Angular 2+ with other technologies such
            as Firebase and RxJS.

        <p>I built an e-commerce website using Angular 2+ as the front-end framework. The website was designed to be
            responsive and user-friendly, with a clean and modern interface. I used the latest front-end
            technologies such as CSS Grid and Flexbox for layout and animations, and Angular Material for UI
            components.</p>
