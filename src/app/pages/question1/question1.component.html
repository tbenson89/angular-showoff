            Project: E-commerce Website
        </div>
        <div class="card-body">
            <p>I built an e-commerce website using Angular 2+ as the front-end framework. The website was designed to be
                responsive and user-friendly, with a clean and modern interface. I used the latest front-end
                technologies such as CSS Grid and Flexbox for layout and animations, and Angular Material for UI
                components.</p>
